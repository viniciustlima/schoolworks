        Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman
        who founded <a href="http://X.com">X.com</a> in 1999 (which later became
        PaypPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Telsa Motors in 2003.

        Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that
        would send the first commercial vehicle to the International Space
        Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in
        2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an
        advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump’s

      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10">
        Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child,
        Musk was so lost in his daydreams about inventions that his parents and
        doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12">
        At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk
        developed an interest in computers. He taught himself how to program,
        and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called
        Blastar.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">
        In grade school, Musk was short, introverted and bookish. He was bullied
        until he was 15 and went through a growth spurt and learned how to
        defend himself with karate and wrestling.

        Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, is a Canadian model and the oldest woman to
        star in a Covergirl campaign. When Musk was growing up, she worked five
        jobs at one point to support her family.

        Musk’s father, Errol Musk, is a wealthy South African engineer.

      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="21" data-line-end="22">
        Musk spent his early childhood with his brother Kimbal and sister Tosca
        in South Africa. His parents divorced when he was 10.

        At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University
        and avoid mandatory service in the South African military. Musk obtained
        his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it would be
        easier to obtain American citizenship via that path.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">
        In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the
        University of Pennsylvania. He graduated with an undergraduate degree in
        economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="29" data-line-end="30">
        After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to
        pursue a PhD in energy physics. However, his move was timed perfectly
        with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just two
        days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2
        Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.

        Musk launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his
        brother, Kimbal Musk. An online city guide, Zip2 was soon providing
        content for the new websites of both The New York Times and the Chicago
        Tribune. In 1999, a division of Compaq Computer Corporation bought Zip2
        for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options.

        services/payments company. An
        <a href="http://X.com">X.com</a> acquisition the following year led to
        the creation of PayPal as it is known today.

        Musk founded his third company, Space Exploration Technologies
        Corporation, or SpaceX, in 2002 with the intention of building
        spacecraft for commercial space travel. By 2008, SpaceX was well
        established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo
        transport for the International Space Station—with plans for astronaut
        transport in the future—in a move to replace NASA’s own space shuttle
        missions.

      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="44" data-line-end="45">
        On May 22, 2012, Musk and SpaceX made history when the company launched
        its Falcon 9 rocket into space with an unmanned capsule. The vehicle was
        sent to the International Space Station with 1,000 pounds of supplies
        for the astronauts stationed there, marking the first time a private
        company had sent a spacecraft to the International Space Station. Of the
        launch, Musk was quoted as saying, “I feel very lucky. … For us, it’s
        like winning the Super Bowl.”
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="57" data-line-end="58">
        In September 2017, Musk presented an updated design plan for his BFR (an
        acronym for either “Big F—ing Rocket” or “Big Falcon Rocket”), a
        31-engine behemoth topped by a spaceship capable of carrying at least
        100 people. He revealed that SpaceX was aiming to launch the first cargo
        missions to Mars with the vehicle in 2022, as part of his overarching
        goal of colonizing the Red Planet.

        SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites in May 2019, and
        followed with another payload of 60 satellites that November. While this
        represented significant progress for the Starlink venture, the
        appearance of these bright orbiters in the night sky, with the potential
        of thousands more to come, worried astronomers who felt that a
        proliferation of satellites would increase the difficulty of studying
        distant objects in space.

        Five years after its formation, in March 2008, Tesla unveiled the
        Roadster, a sports car capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7
        seconds, as well as traveling nearly 250 miles between charges of its
        lithium ion battery.

        In August 2016, in Musk’s continuing effort to promote and advance
        sustainable energy and products for a wider consumer base, a $2.6
        billion dollar deal was solidified to combine his electric car and solar
        energy companies. His Tesla Motors Inc. announced an all-stock deal
        purchase of SolarCity Corp., a company Musk had helped his cousins start
        in 2006. He is a majority shareholder in each entity.

        In January 2017, Musk launched The Boring Company, a company devoted to
        boring and building tunnels in order to reduce street traffic. He began
        with a test dig on the SpaceX property in Los Angeles.

      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="87" data-line-end="88">
        In late October of that year, Musk posted the first photo of his
        company’s progress to his Instagram page. He said the 500-foot tunnel,
        which would generally run parallel to Interstate 405, would reach a
        length of two miles in approximately four months.

        In August 2013, Musk released a concept for a new form of transportation
        called the “Hyperloop,” an invention that would foster commuting between
        major cities while severely cutting travel time. Ideally resistant to
        weather and powered by renewable energy, the Hyperloop would propel
        riders in pods through a network of low-pressure tubes at speeds
        reaching more than 700 mph. Musk noted that the Hyperloop could take
        from seven to 10 years to be built and ready for use.
      </p>
      <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="96" data-line-end="97">
        Although he introduced the Hyperloop with claims that it would be safer
        than a plane or train, with an estimated cost of $6 billion —
        approximately one-tenth of the cost for the rail system planned by the
        state of California — Musk’s concept has drawn skepticism. Nevertheless,
        the entrepreneur has sought to encourage the development of this idea.

        After he announced a competition for teams to submit their designs for a
        Hyperloop pod prototype, the first Hyperloop Pod Competition was held at
        the SpaceX facility in January 2017. A speed record of 284 mph was set
        by a German student engineering team at competition No. 3 in 2018, with

        Neuralink, which intends to create devices to be implanted in the human
        brain and help people merge with software. He expanded on the company’s
        progress during a July 2019 discussion, revealing that its devices will

        transport passengers from O’Hare Airport to downtown Chicago in 20
        minutes or less, Musk tweeted that he was all-in on the competition with
        The Boring Company. He said that the concept of the Chicago loop would
        be different from his Hyperloop, its relatively short route not
        requiring the need for drawing a vacuum to eliminate air friction.
